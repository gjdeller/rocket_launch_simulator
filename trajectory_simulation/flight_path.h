    User Interface: 
    step 1) utilize all input values to create a UI 
    that shows the path that the rocket will take
    based on user inputs

    step 2) in the User Interface make sure that it has a rocket
    and then a red line that indicates the launch curve over time based
    on the user's launch angle

    step 3) based on the User's launch angle, determine if the rocket will hit
    either earth or orbit insertion etc...
